--- abstract

Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
which may have different performance and connectivity
characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
establishing a connection more quickly. This document specifies
requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
provides an example algorithm, referred to as "Happy Eyeballs". This
document updates the algorithm description in RFC 8305.

# Introduction

Many communication protocols operating over the modern Internet use
hostnames. These often resolve to multiple IP addresses, each of
which may have different performance and connectivity
characteristics. Since specific addresses or address families (IPv4
or IPv6) may be blocked, broken, or sub-optimal on a network, clients
that attempt multiple connections in parallel have a chance of
establishing a connection more quickly. This document specifies
requirements for algorithms that reduce this user-visible delay and
provides an example algorithm.

This document defines the algorithm for "Happy Eyeballs", a technique
for reducing user-visible delays on dual-stack hosts. This
definition updates the description in {{?HEV2=RFC8305}}, which
itself obsoleted {{?RFC6555}}.

The Happy Eyeballs algorithm of racing connections to resolved
addresses has several stages to avoid delays to the user whenever
possible, while respecting client priorities, such as preferring
the use of IPv6 or the availability of protocols like HTTP/3 {{?HTTP3=RFC9114}} and
TLS Encrypted Client Hello {{!ECH=I-D.ietf-tls-esni}}. This document discusses
how to initiate DNS queries when starting a connection, how to
sort the list of destination addresses received from DNS answers,
and how to race the connection attempts.

The major difference between the algorithm defined in this document
and {{HEV2}} is the addition of support for SVCB / HTTPS resource
records {{!SVCB=RFC9460}}. SVCB records provide alternative
endpoints and information about application protocol support, Encrypted
Client Hello {{ECH}} keys, address hints, and other relevant details
about the services being accessed. Discovering protocol support during
resolution, such as for HTTP/3 over QUIC {{HTTP3}}, allows
upgrading between protocols on the current connection attempts,
instead of waiting for subsequent attempts to use information from
other discovery mechanisms such as HTTP Alternative Services
{{?AltSvc=RFC7838}}. These records can be queried along with A and
AAAA records, and the updated algorithm defines how to handle SVCB
responses to improve connection establishment.

#  Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}


# Overview

This document defines a method of connection establishment, named the
"Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup". This approach has several
distinct phases:

1. Asynchronous resolution of a hostname into destination addresses ({{resolution}})

1. Sorting of the resolved destination addresses ({{sorting}})

1. Initiation of asynchronous connection attempts ({{connections}})

1. Successful establishment of one connection and cancellation of
other attempts ({{connections}})

Note that this document assumes that the preference policy for the
host destination address favors IPv6 over IPv4. IPv6 has many
desirable properties designed to be improvements over IPv4
{{?IPV6=RFC8200}}.

This document also assumes that the preference policy favors QUIC over
TCP. QUIC only requires one packet to establish a secure connection,
making it quicker compared to TCP {{?QUIC=RFC9000}}.

If the host is configured to have different preferences, the
recommendations in this document can be easily adapted.

# Hostname Resolution {#resolution}

When a client is trying to establish a connection to a named host,
it needs to determine which destination IP addresses it can use
to reach the host. The client resolves the hostname into IP
addresses by sending DNS queries and collecting the answers.
This section describes how a client initiates DNS queries
and asynchronously handles the answers.

## Sending DNS Queries

Clients first need to determine which DNS resource records
they will include in queries for a named host.

This decision is based on if client has "connectivity" using IPv4 and IPv6.
In this case, "connectivity" for an address family is defined
as having at least one local address of the family from which
to send packets, and at least one non-link local route for
the address family.

When a client has both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity, it needs to
send out queries for both AAAA and A records. On a network with
only IPv4 connectivity, it will send a query for A records. On a
network with only IPv6 connectivity, the client will either send
out queries for both AAAA and A records, or only a query for AAAA
records, depending on the network configuration. See {{v6only}}
for more discussion of handling IPv6-mostly and IPv6-only networks.

In addition to requesting AAAA and A records, depending on which
application is establishing the connection, clients can request
either SVCB or HTTPS records {{SVCB}}. For applications using
HTTP or HTTPS (including applications using WebSockets), the
client SHOULD send a query for HTTPS records.

All of the DNS queries SHOULD be made as soon after one another as
possible. The order in which the queries are sent SHOULD be as
follows (omitting any query that doesn't apply based on the
logic described above):

1. SVCB or HTTPS query
1. AAAA query
1. A query

## Handling DNS Answers Asynchronously

Once the client receives sufficient answers to its DNS queries, it can
move onto the phases of sorting addresses ({{sorting}})
and establishing connections ({{connections}}).

Implementations SHOULD NOT wait for all answers to return
before starting the next steps of connection establishment. If one query
fails or takes significantly longer to return, waiting for
those answers can significantly delay connection
establishment that could otherwise proceed with already received answers.

Therefore, the client SHOULD treat DNS resolution as asynchronous,
processing different record types independently.
Note that if the platform does not offer an asynchronous DNS API,
this behavior can be simulated by making separate synchronous queries
for each record type in parallel.

The client moves onto sorting addresses and establishing connections
once one of the following condition sets is met:

Either:

- Some positive (non-empty) address answers have been received AND
- A postive (non-empty) or negative (empty) answer has been received
for the preferred address family that was queried AND
- SVCB/HTTPS service information has been received (or has received
a negative response)

Or:

- Some positive (non-empty) address answers have been received AND
- A resolution time delay has passed after which other answers have
not been received

Positive answers can be addresses received either from AAAA or A
records, or address hints received directly in SVCB/HTTPS records.

Negative answers are exclusively responses to AAAA or A records
that contain no addresses (with or without an error like NXDOMAIN).
If all answers come back with negative answers, the
connection establishment will fail or need to wait until other answers
are received.

On networks that have both default routes for IPv6 and IPv4, IPv6 is
assumed to be the preferred address family. If only one of IPv6 or IPv4 has
a default route, that address family should be considered the preferred address
family for progressing the algorithm.

The resolution time delay is a short time that provides a chance
to receive preferred addresses (via AAAA records) along
with service information (via SVCB/HTTPS records). This accounts
for the case where the AAAA or SVCB/HTTPS records follow the
A records by a few milliseconds. This delay is referred to as
the "Resolution Delay".

The RECOMMENDED value for the Resolution Delay is 50 milliseconds.

### Resolving SVCB/HTTPS Aliases and Targets

SVCB and HTTPS records describe information for network services. Individual
records are either AliasMode or ServiceMode records, where AliasMode requires
another SVCB/HTTPS query for the alias name. ServiceMode records either are
associated with the original name being queried, in which case their TargetName
is ".", or are associated with another service name (see {{Section 2.5 of SVCB}}).

The algorithm in this document does not consider service information to be received
until ServiceMode records are available.

ServiceMode records can contain address hints via `ipv6hint` and `ipv4hint`
parameters. When these are received, they SHOULD be considered as positive
non-empty answers for the purpose of the algorithm when A and AAAA records
corresponding to the TargetName are not available yet. Note that clients are
still required to issue A and AAAA queries for those TargetNames if they haven't
yet received those records. When those records are received, they replace the hints
and update the available set of responses as new answers (see {{new-answers}}).

### Examples

TODO: Provide examples of various scenarios (simple dual stack, SVCB,
delayed AAAA, delayed SVCB, SVCB hints providing early answers)

## Handling New Answers {#new-answers}

If new records arrive while connection attempts are in progress,
but before any connection has been established, then any newly
received addresses are incorporated into the list of available candidate
addresses (see {{changes}}) and the process of connection attempts will
continue with the new addresses added, until one connection is
established.

## Handling Multiple DNS Server Addresses

If multiple DNS server addresses are configured for the current
network, the client may have the option of sending its DNS queries
over IPv4 or IPv6. Guidelines for DNS stub resolvers in this
scenario are described in {{Section 4.3 of ?I-D.ietf-dnsop-3901bis}}.

Client systems SHOULD NOT have an explicit limit to the number of DNS
servers that can be configured, either manually or by the network.
If such a limit is required by hardware limitations, the client
SHOULD use at least one address from each address family from the
available list.

# Grouping and Sorting Addresses {#sorting}

Before attempting to connect to any of the resolved destination
addresses, the client defines the order in which to start the
attempts. Once the order has been defined, the client can use a
simple algorithm for racing each option after a short delay (see
{{connections}}). It is important that the ordered list involve all
addresses from both families and all protocols that have been received
by this point, as this allows the client to get the racing effect of
Happy Eyeballs for the entire list, not just the first IPv4 and first
IPv6 addresses.

The client performs three levels of grouping
and sorting of addresses based on the DNS answers received.
Each subsequent level of sorting only changes orders and
preferences within the previously defined groups.

1. Grouping and sorting by application protocol and security requirements ({{application-group}})
1. Grouping and sorting by service priorities ({{service-group}})
1. Sorting by destination address preferences ({{address-sorting}})

## Grouping By Application Protocols and Security Requirements {#application-group}

Clients first group based on which application protocols the
destination endpoints support and which security features
those endpoints offer. These are based on
information from SVCB/HTTPS records about application-layer protocols
("alpn" values) and other parameters like TLS Encrypted Client Hello
configuration ("ech" values, see {{!SVCB-ECH=I-D.ietf-tls-svcb-ech}}).

For cases where the answers do not include any SVCB/HTTPS information,
or if all of the answers are associated with the same SVCB/HTTPS record,
this step is trivial: all answers belong to one group, and the client
assumes they support the same protocols and security properties.

However, the client is aware of different sets of destination endpoints
that advertise different capabilities when it receives multiple distinct
SVCB/HTTPS records. The client SHOULD separate these
addresses into different groups, such that all addresses in a
group share the same application protocols and relevant security
properties. The specific parameters that are relevant to the client
depend on the client implementation and application.

Note that some destination addresses might need to be added to
multiple groups at this stage. For example, consider the following
HTTPS records:

~~~
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc1.example.com. (
     alpn="h3,h2" ipv6hint=2001:db8::2 )
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc2.example.com. (
     alpn="h2" ipv6hint=2001:db8::4 )
~~~

In this case, 2001:db8::2 can be used with HTTP/3 and HTTP/2,
but 2001:db8::4 can only be used with HTTP/2. If the client
creates a grouping for HTTP/3-capable addresses and
HTTP/2-capable addresses, 2001:db8::2 would exist in both
groups (assuming that all other security properties are
the same).

Connection racing as described in {{connections}} applies
to different destination address options within one of these groups.
The logic for prioritizing and falling back between groups
of addresses with different security properties and protocol
properties is implementation-defined.

### When to Apply Application Preferences

Whether or not specific application protocols or security features
are grouped separately is a client application decision. Clients
SHOULD avoid grouping and sorting separately in cases where their
use of an application protocol or feature is non-critical.

For example, an HTTP client loading a simple webpage may not see a large
difference between using HTTP/3 or HTTP/2, and thus can group the ALPNs together
to respect service-determined priorities where HTTP/3 might be
prioritized behind HTTP/2. However, another client might see significant
performance improvements by using HTTP/3's ability to send unreliable
frames for its application use-case and will group HTTP/3 before HTTP/2.

Similarly, a particular application might require or strongly prefer the
use of TLS ECH for privacy-sensitive traffic, while others might
support ECH opportunistically.

{{Section 8 of SVCB-ECH}} recommends against SVCB record sets that contain
some answers that include ECH configuration and some that don't, but notes
that such cases are possible. It is possible that services only include
ECH configurations on SVCB answers that are prioritized behind others
that don't include ECH configurations; for example, this might be
used as an experimenation or roll-out strategy. Due to such cases, clients
ought to not arbitrarily group ECH-containing answers and sort them
first if they won't use the ECH information, or if the connection would
not benefit from the use of ECH. However, for cases where there is a
reason for an application preference for ECH, the client MAY group
and prioritize those answers separately. Even though this might conflict
with the published service record priorities, any answers published
by the service are eligible to be used by clients, and clients can
choose to use them.

## Grouping By Service Priority {#service-group}

The next step of grouping and sorting is to group across different
services (as defined by SVCB/HTTPS records), and sort these groups
by priority.

This step allows server-published priorities to be reflected
in the client connection establishment algorithm.

SVCB {{SVCB}} records indicate a priority for each ServiceMode response.
This priority applies to any IPv4 or IPv6 address hints in the record
itself, as well as any addresses received on A or AAAA queries for the
name in the ServiceMode record. The priority in a SVCB ServiceMode record is
always greater than 0.

SVCB answers with the lowest numerical value (such as 1) are sorted
first, and answers with higher numerical values are sorted later.

Note that a SVCB record with the TargetName "." applies to the owner
name in the record, and the priority of that SVCB record applies to
any A or AAAA records for the same owner name. These answers are
sorted according to that SVCB record's priority.

All addresses received from a particular SVCB service (within a group
as defined in {{application-group}}), either by an associated AAAA
or A record or address hints, SHOULD be separated into a group by
the client. These service-based groups SHOULD then be sorted
using the service priority.

For cases where the answers do not include any SVCB/HTTPS information,
or if all of the answers are associated with the same SVCB/HTTPS record,
this step is trivial: all answers belong to one group that has the same
priority.

When there are multiple services, and thus multiple groups, with the
same priority, the client SHOULD shuffle these groups randomly.

If there are some SVCB/HTTPS services received, but there are AAAA or A
records that do not have an associated service (for example, if no
SVCB/HTTPS record is received for the original name using the "."
TargetName), the unassociated addresses SHOULD be put in a group
that is prioritized at the end of the list.

## Sorting Destination Addresses Within Groups {#address-sorting}

Within each group of addresses, after grouping based on the logic
in {{application-group}} and {{service-group}}, the client sorts
the addresses based on preference and historical data.

First, the client MUST sort the addresses using Destination Address
Selection ({{!RFC6724, Section 6}}).

If the client is stateful and has a history of expected round-trip
times (RTTs) for the routes to access each address, it SHOULD add a
Destination Address Selection rule between rules 8 and 9 that prefers
addresses with lower RTTs. If the client keeps track of which
addresses it used in the past, it SHOULD add another Destination
Address Selection rule between the RTT rule and rule 9, which prefers
used addresses over unused ones. This helps servers that use the
client's IP address during authentication, as is the case for TCP
Fast Open {{?RFC7413}} and some Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)
cookies. This historical data MUST be partitioned using the same
boundaries used for privacy-sensitive information specific to that endpoint,
and MUST NOT be used across different network interfaces. The data SHOULD
be flushed whenever a device changes the network to which it is attached.
However, if a client can reliably identify a previously attached network,
it MAY retain and resume using historical data associated with that network
upon reconnection. Clients that use historical data MUST ensure that clients
with different historical data will eventually converge toward the same
behaviors. For example, clients can periodically ignore historical data to
ensure that fresh addresses are attempted.

Next, the client SHOULD modify the ordered list to interleave
address families. Whichever address family is first in the list
should be followed by an endpoint of the other address family. For example,
if the first address in the sorted list is an IPv6 address, then
the first IPv4 address should be moved up in the list to be second
in the list. An implementation MAY choose to favor one
address family more by allowing multiple addresses of that
family to be attempted before trying the next.
The number of contiguous addresses of the first address family of
properties will be referred to as the "Preferred Address Family
Count" and can be a configurable value. This avoids waiting through a
long list of addresses from a given address family if connectivity
over that address family is impaired.

Note that the address selection described in this section only
applies to destination addresses; Source Address Selection
({{!RFC6724-UPDATE=I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6724-update, Section 3.2}}) is performed
once per destination address and is out of scope of this document.

# Connection Attempts {#connections}

Once the list of addresses received up to this point has been
constructed, the client will attempt to make connections. In order to
avoid unreasonable network load, connection attempts SHOULD NOT be
made simultaneously. Instead, one connection attempt to a single
address is started first, followed by the others, one at a
time. Starting a new connection attempt does not affect previous
attempts, as multiple connection attempts may occur in parallel.  Once
one of the connection attempts succeeds ({{success}}), all other
connections attempts that have not yet succeeded SHOULD be canceled.
Any address that was not yet attempted as a connection SHOULD be
ignored.  At that time, any asynchronous DNS queries MAY be canceled as
new addresses will not be used for this connection. However, the DNS
client resolver SHOULD still process DNS replies from the network for
a short period of time (recommended to be 1 second), as they will
populate the DNS cache and can be used for subsequent connections.

If grouping addresses by application or security requirements
({{application-group}}) produced multiple groups, the application
SHOULD start with connection attempts to the most preferred option.
The policy for attempting any addresses outside of the most preferred
group is up to the client implementation and out of scope for this document.

If grouping addresses by service ({{service-group}}) produced multiple
groups, all of the addresses of the first group SHOULD be started
before starting attempts using the next group. Attempts across service groups
SHOULD be allowed to continue in parallel; in effect, the groups
are flattened into a single list.

A simple implementation can have a fixed delay for how long to wait
before starting the next connection attempt. This delay is referred to
as the "Connection Attempt Delay". One recommended value for a default
delay is 250 milliseconds. A more nuanced implementation's delay
should correspond to the time when the previous attempt is retrying
its handshake (such as sending a second TCP SYN or a second QUIC
Initial), based on the retransmission timer ({{!RFC6298}},
{{?RFC9002}}). If the client has historical RTT data gathered from
other connections to the same host or prefix, it can use this
information to influence its delay. Note that this algorithm should
only try to approximate the time of the first handshake packet
retransmission, and not any further retransmissions that may be
influenced by exponential timer back off. Clients that support
session resumption mechanisms (such as TLS session tickets
{{?RFC8446}} or QUIC 0-RTT {{?RFC9001}}) SHOULD use the same
Connection Attempt Delay for resumed connections as for new
connections.

The Connection Attempt Delay MUST have a lower bound, especially if it
is computed using historical data. More specifically, a subsequent
connection MUST NOT be started within 10 milliseconds of the previous
attempt. The recommended minimum value is 100 milliseconds, which is
referred to as the "Minimum Connection Attempt Delay". This minimum
value is required to avoid congestion collapse in the presence of high
packet-loss rates. The Connection Attempt Delay SHOULD have an upper
bound, referred to as the "Maximum Connection Attempt Delay". The
current recommended value is 2 seconds.

The Connection Attempt Delay is used to set a timer, referred to as
the "Next Connection Attempt Timer". Whenever this timer fires and
a connection has not been successfully established, the next
connection attempt starts, and the timer either is reset to a new
delay value or, in the case of the end of the list being reached,
is cancelled. Note that the delay value can be different for each
connection attempt (depending on the protocol being used and
the estimated RTT).

## Determining successful connection establishment {#success}

The determination of when a connection attempt has successfully
completed (and other attempts can be cancelled) ultimately depends
on the client application's interpretation of the connection
state being ready to use. This will generally include at least
the transport-level handshake with the remote endpoint (such as
the TCP or QUIC handshake), but can involve other higher-level
handshakes or state checks as well.

Client connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol
on top, such as for unencrypted HTTP connections) will determine
successful establishment based on completing the TCP handshake
only. When TLS is used on top of of TCP (such as for encrypted HTTP
connections), clients SHOULD wait for the TLS handshake to
successfully complete before cancelling other connection
attempts. This is particularly useful for networks in which a
TCP-terminating proxy might be causing TCP handshakes to succeed
quickly, even though end-to-end connectivity with the TLS-terminating
server will fail. QUIC connections inherently include a secure
handshake in their main handshakes, and thus usually only need to
wait for a single handshake to complete.

Beyond TCP, TLS, and/or QUIC handshakes, clients may also wait for
other requirements to be met before determining that the connection
establishment was successful. For example, clients generally validate that
the server's certificate provided via TLS is trusted, and that operation can
be asynchronous.

In cases where the connection establishment determination goes beyond
the initial transport handshake, the Next Connection Attempt Timer
ought to be adjusted after the initial transport handshake is completed.
When the connection establishment makes progress, but has not completed,
the timer SHOULD be extended to a new value that represents an estimated
time for the full connection establishment to complete.

For example, consider a case where connection establishment involves
both a TCP handshake and a TLS handshake. If the timer is initially set
to be roughly at the time when a TCP SYN packet would be retransmitted,
and the TCP handshake completes before the timer fires, the timer should
be adjusted to allow for the time in which the TLS handshake could complete.

While transport layer handshakes generally do not have restrictions on
attempts to establish a connection, some cryptographic handshakes may
be dependent on SVCB ServiceMode records and could impose limitations on
establishing a connection.  For instance, ECH-capable clients may
become SVCB-reliant clients ({{Section 3 of SVCB}}) when SVCB records
contain the "ech" SvcParamKey {{SVCB-ECH}}. If the
client is either an SVCB-reliant client or a SVCB-optional client that
might switch to SVCB-reliant connection establishment during the
process, the client MUST wait for SVCB records before proceeding with the
cryptographic handshake.

## Handling Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

The `alpn` and `no-default-alpn` SvcParamKeys in SVCB records indicate the
"SVCB ALPN set," which specifies the underlying transport protocols
supported by the associated service endpoint. When the client requests
SVCB records, it SHOULD perform the procedure specified in {{Section 7.1.2
of SVCB}} to determine the underlying transport protocols that both
the client and the service endpoint support. The client SHOULD NOT
attempt to make a connection to a service endpoint whose SVCB ALPN set
does not contain any protocols that the client supports. For example,
suppose the client is an HTTP client that only supports TCP-based
versions such as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and it receives the following
HTTPS record:

~~~
 example.com. 60 IN HTTPS 1 svc1.example.com. (
     alpn="h3" no-default-alpn ipv6hint=2001:db8::2 )
~~~

In this case, attempting a connection to 2001:db8::2 or any other
address resolved for `svc1.example.com` would be incorrect because the
record indicates that `svc1.example.com` only supports HTTP/3, based on
the ALPN value of "h3".

If the client is an HTTP client that supports both Alt-Svc
{{?AltSvc=RFC7838}} and SVCB (HTTPS) records, the client SHOULD ensure
that connection attempts are consistent with both the Alt-Svc
parameters and the SVCB ALPN set, as specified in {{Section 9.3 of
SVCB}}.

## Dropping or Pending Connection Attempts

Some situations related to handling SVCB responses can
require connection attempts to be dropped, or pended until
SVCB responses return.

{{Section 3.1 of SVCB}} describes client behavior for handling
resolution failures when responses are "cryptographically protected"
using DNSSEC {{?DNSSEC=RFC9364}} or encrypted DNS ({{?DOT=RFC7858}},
{{?DOH=RFC8484}}, or {{?DOQ=RFC9250}}, for example). If SVCB
resolution fails when using cryptographic protection, clients
SHOULD abandon connection attempts altogether to avoid
downgrade attacks.

Use of cryptographic protection in DNS can influence other
parts of Happy Eyeballs connection establishment, as well.

Situations in which DNS is not protected allow for any records
to be blocked or modified, so security properties derived from
SVCB records are opportunistic only. However, when DNS is cryptographically
protected, clients can be stricter about relying on the properties
from SVCB records.

{{Section 5.1 of SVCB}} explains that clients "MUST NOT transmit any
information that could be altered by the SVCB response until it arrives",
and specifically mentions properties that affect the TLS ClientHello.
This restriction specifically applies when a client's behavior will
be altered by the SVCB response, which depends both on the client
implementation's ability to support a particular feature, as well
as the client implementation's willingness to rely on the SVCB
response to enable a particular feature.

Based on this, clients in some scenarios MUST pend starting
a TLS handshake (either after TCP or as part of QUIC) until SVCB
responses have been received, even after the "Resolution Delay"
defined in {{resolution}} has been reached. Specifically, clients
MUST pend starting handshakes if *all* of the following are true:

1. DNS responses are cryptographically protected with DNSSEC or
encrypted DNS. Note that, if unencrypted and unsigned DNS is used, SVCB
information is opportunistic; clients MAY wait for SVCB responses
but do not need to.

1. The client implementation supports parsing and using a particular
security-related SVCB parameter, such as the "ech" SvcParamKey
{{SVCB-ECH}}. (In contrast,
implementations that do not support actively using ECH do
not need to wait for SVCB resolution if that is the only
reason to do so).

1. The client relies on the presence of the particular
SVCB-related parameter to enable the relevant protocol feature.
For example, if a connection attempt would normally be
using cleartext HTTP unless an HTTPS DNS record would
cause the client to upgrade, the client needs to
wait for the record; however, if the client already
would be using HTTP over TLS, then it is not relying
on that signal from SVCB. As another example, some SVCB
properties can affect the TLS ClientHello in ways that optimize
performance (like `tls-supported-groups` {{?I-D.ietf-tls-key-share-prediction}})
but only aim to save round trips. The other TLS groups
can be discovered through the TLS handshake itself, instead
of SVCB, and thus do not require waiting for SVCB responses.

# DNS Answer Changes During Happy Eyeballs Connection Setup {#changes}

If, during the course of connection establishment, the DNS answers
change by either adding resolved addresses (for example due to DNS
push notifications {{?RFC8765}}) or removing previously resolved
addresses (for example, due to expiry of the TTL on that DNS record),
the client should react based on its current progress. Additionally, addresses
from SVCB IP hints SHOULD be removed from the list once A and AAAA records are
received for the corresponding name, if the addresses from the hints are absent from the
received records {{Section 7.3 of SVCB}}.

If an address is removed from the list that already had a connection
attempt started, the connection attempt SHOULD NOT be canceled, but
rather be allowed to continue. If the removed address had not yet
had a connection attempt started, it SHOULD be removed from the list
of addresses to try.

If an address is added to the list, its position SHOULD be determined by
applying the sorting rules (see {{sorting}}) to the complete list of addresses,
including those previously received. This ensures that sorting rules, such as address family
interleaving, are maintained correctly regardless of when addresses arrive. For
example, consider a connection attempt in which only IPv6 addresses
are available initially, and an attempt to one IPv6 address is already in progress.
Then, when IPv4 addresses are later received, an IPv4 address should be placed next in the list of addresses to attempt
(to account for interleaving address families) ahead of any remaining IPv6 addresses, as if it had been available initially.

# Supporting IPv6-Mostly and IPv6-Only Networks {#v6only}

While many IPv6 transition protocols have been standardized and
deployed, most are transparent to client devices. Supporting IPv6-only
networks often requires specific client-side changes, especially when
interacting with IPv4-only services. Two primary mechanisms for this
are the combined use of NAT64 {{!RFC6146}} with DNS64 {{!RFC6147}}, or
leveraging NAT64 with a discovered PREF64 prefix {{!RFC8781}}.

One possible way to handle these networks is for the client device
networking stack to implement 464XLAT {{?RFC6877}}. 464XLAT has the
advantage of not requiring changes to user space software; however, it
requires per-packet translation if the application is using IPv4
literals and does not encourage client application software to support
native IPv6. On platforms that do not support 464XLAT, the Happy
Eyeballs engine SHOULD follow the recommendations in this section to
properly support IPv6-mostly ({{?V6-MOSTLY=I-D.ietf-v6ops-6mops}}) and IPv6-only networks.

The features described in this section SHOULD only be enabled when the
host detects an IPv6-mostly or IPv6-only network. A simple heuristic
to detect one of these networks is to check if the network offers
routable IPv6 addressing, does not offer routable IPv4 addressing, and
offers a DNS resolver address.

## IPv4 Address Literals {#literals}

If client applications or users wish to connect to IPv4 address
literals, the Happy Eyeballs engine will need to perform NAT64 address
synthesis for them. The solution is similar to "Bump-in-the-Host"
{{!RFC6535}} but is implemented inside the Happy Eyeballs client.

Note that some IPv4 prefixes are scoped to a given host or network,
such as 0.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, and
255.255.255.255/32, and therefore do not require NAT64 address
synthesis.

## Discovering and Utilizing PREF64 {#pref64-detection}

When an IPv4 address is passed into the Happy Eyeballs implementation
instead of a hostname, it SHOULD use PREF64s received from Router
Advertisements {{!RFC8781}}.

With PREF64 available, networks might choose to not deploy DNS64, as
the latter has a number of disadvantages (see
{{V6-MOSTLY, Section 4.3.4}}). To ensure
compatibility with such networks, if PREF64 is available, clients
SHOULD send an A query in addition to an AAAA query for a given
hostname. This allows the client to receive any existing IPv4 A
records and perform local NAT64 address synthesis, eliminating the
network's need to run DNS64.

If the network does not provide PREF64s, the implementation SHOULD
query the network for the NAT64 prefix using "Discovery of the IPv6
Prefix Used for IPv6 Address Synthesis" {{!RFC7050}}. It then
synthesizes an appropriate IPv6 address (or several) using the
encoding described in "IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/ IPv6 Translators"
{{!RFC6052}}. The synthesized addresses are then inserted into the
list of addresses as if they were results from DNS A queries;
connection attempts follow the algorithm described above (see
{{connections}}).

Such translation also applies to any IPv4 addresses received in A
records and IPv4 address hints received in SVCB records.

## Supporting DNS64 {#dns64}

If PREF64 is not available and the NAT64 prefix cannot be discovered,
clients SHOULD assume the network is relying on DNS64 for IPv4-to-IPv6
address synthesis. In this scenario, clients will typically only
receive AAAA records from DNS queries, as DNS64 servers synthese these
records for IPv4-only domains.

## Hostnames with Broken AAAA Records {#broken}

At the time of writing, there exist a small but non-negligible number
of hostnames that resolve to valid A records and broken AAAA records,
which we define as AAAA records that contain seemingly valid IPv6
addresses but those addresses never reply when contacted on the usual
ports. These can be, for example, caused by:

- Mistyping of the IPv6 address in the DNS zone configuration

- Routing black holes

- Service outages

While an algorithm complying with the other sections of this document
would correctly handle such hostnames on a dual-stack network, they
will not necessarily function correctly on IPv6-only networks with
NAT64 and DNS64. Since DNS64 recursive resolvers rely on the
authoritative name servers sending negative (no error, no data)
responses for AAAA records in order to synthesize, they will not
synthesize records for these particular hostnames and will instead
pass through the broken AAAA record.

In order to support these scenarios, the client device needs to query
the DNS for the A record and then perform local synthesis. Since
these types of hostnames are rare and, in order to minimize load on
DNS servers, this A query should only be performed when the client
has given up on the AAAA records it initially received. This can be
achieved by using a longer timeout, referred to as the "Last Resort
Local Synthesis Delay"; the delay is recommended to be 2 seconds.
The timer is started when the last connection attempt is fired. If
no connection attempt has succeeded when this timer fires, the device
queries the DNS for the IPv4 address and, on reception of a valid A
record, treats it as if it were provided by the application (see
{{literals}}).

## Virtual Private Networks

Some Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may be configured to handle DNS
queries from the device. The configuration could encompass all
queries or a subset such as "*.internal.example.com". These VPNs can
also be configured to only route part of the IPv4 address space, such
as 192.0.2.0/24. However, if an internal hostname resolves to an
external IPv4 address, these can cause issues if the underlying
network is IPv6-only. As an example, let's assume that
"www.internal.example.com" has exactly one A record, 198.51.100.42,
and no AAAA records. The client will send the DNS query to the
company's recursive resolver and that resolver will reply with these
records. The device now only has an IPv4 address to connect to and
no route to that address. Since the company's resolver does not know
the NAT64 prefix of the underlying network, it cannot synthesize the
address. Similarly, the underlying network's DNS64 recursive
resolver does not know the company's internal addresses, so it cannot
resolve the hostname. Because of this, the client device needs to
resolve the A record using the company's resolver and then locally
synthesize an IPv6 address, as if the resolved IPv4 address were
provided by the application ({{literals}}).

# Summary of Configurable Values

The values that may be configured as defaults on a client for use in
Happy Eyeballs are as follows:

- Resolution Delay ({{resolution}}): The time to wait for AAAA and/or SVCB/HTTPS
records after receiving an A record. Recommended to be 50 milliseconds.

- Preferred Address Family Count ({{sorting}}): The number of
addresses belonging to the preferred address family (such as IPv6)
that should be attempted before attempting the next address family.
Recommended to be 1; 2 may be used to more aggressively favor a
particular combination of address family and protocol.

- Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The time to wait between
connection attempts in the absence of RTT data. Recommended to be
250 milliseconds.

- Minimum Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The minimum time to
wait between connection attempts. Recommended to be 100
milliseconds. MUST NOT be less than 10 milliseconds.

- Maximum Connection Attempt Delay ({{connections}}): The maximum time to
wait between connection attempts. Recommended to be 2 seconds.

- Last Resort Local Synthesis Delay ({{broken}}): The time to wait
after starting the last IPv6 attempt and before sending the A
query. Recommended to be 2 seconds.

The delay values described in this section were determined
empirically by measuring the timing of connections on a very wide set
of production devices. They were picked to reduce wait times noticed
by users while minimizing load on the network. As time passes, it is
expected that the properties of networks will evolve. For that
reason, it is expected that the values chosen by implementations
will change over time. Implementors MAY use values different from the
recommended values listed above, without changing this specification,
as long as they do not violate any of the normative requirements (such
as minimum delays).

# Limitations

Happy Eyeballs will handle initial connection failures at the transport
layer (such as TCP or QUIC); however, other failures or performance
issues may still affect the chosen connection.

## Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery

Connections that use TCP only (without TLS or another protocol on top)
perform connection racing only during the TCP handshake. Such connections
can encounter issues where the handshake (using small packets) completes
but then large packets are dropped or incorrectly handled by the network
due to a small MTU being configured on the network. Such issues might be specific to IPv6
traffic on the network.

This problem can also occur when TLS is used, but the larger
messages used in many TLS handshakes are often sufficient to
ensure maximum-size TCP segments are deliverable. For QUIC
connections, a minimum MTU of at least 1200 bytes
{{!RFC9000, Section 8.1-5}} is guaranteed, but there is a chance that
larger values may not be available.

Solving these issues is out of scope of this document. One suggested
approach is to use "Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery" {{!RFC4821}}.

## Application Layer

If the DNS returns multiple addresses for different application
servers, the application itself may not be operational and functional
on all of them. Common examples include Transport Layer Security
(TLS) and HTTP.

## Hiding Operational Issues

It has been observed in practice that Happy Eyeballs can hide issues
in networks. For example, if a misconfiguration causes IPv6 to
consistently fail on a given network while IPv4 is still functional,
Happy Eyeballs may impair the operator's ability to notice the issue.
It is recommended that network operators deploy external means of
monitoring to ensure functionality of all address families.

# Security Considerations

Note that applications should not rely upon a stable
hostname-to-address mapping to ensure any security properties, since
DNS results may change between queries. Happy Eyeballs may make it
more likely that subsequent connections to a single hostname use
different IP addresses.

When using HTTP, HTTPS resource records indicate that clients should
require HTTPS when connecting to an origin (see {{Section 9.5 of
!RFC9460}}), so an active attacker can attempt a downgrade attack by
interfering with the successful delivery of HTTPS resource records.
When clients use insecure DNS mechanisms, any on-path attacker can
simply drop HTTPS resource records, so clients cannot tell the
difference between an attack and a resolver that fails to respond to
HTTPS queries.

However, when using cryptographically protected DNS mechanisms, as
described in {{Section 3.1 of !RFC9460}}, both SVCB-reliant and
SVCB-optional clients MUST NOT send any unencrypted data after the TCP
handshake completes unless they have received a valid HTTPS response.
Those clients need to complete a TLS handshake before proceeding if
that response is non-negative.
